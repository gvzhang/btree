# btree

Append-only B+Tree implemented purely in PHP. Intended to be an efficient key-value storage. B+Tree is a very popular in storage systems (databases) because of its fast retrieval even with millions of records.

## API

Get the instance:

    $btree = btree::open('my.tree');

`btree::open()` takes one argument â€“ path to file with B+Tree. If file does not exists, it is created for you. `btree::open()` returns `FALSE` in case that anything went wrong, newly created otherwise.

Set (insert, update) a value for some key:

    $btree->set('key', 'value');

`set()` returns `FALSE` on failure, `TRUE` otherwise.

Get the value:

    $btree->get('key');

If key does not exist or anything goes wrong, `get()` returns `NULL`. Value under the key is returned otherwise.

Delete key:

    $btree->set('key', NULL);

`NULL`s (deletes) the key. Same return values as in case of inserting/updating value.

That is all you need.

## Advanced

### Range searches

    $btree->range("startkey", "endkey");

And you'll get array of values whose key is greater than or equal to "startkey" and less than "endkey".

### Get all values

`range()` (assuming you do not have keys like "\xff\xff...") should do it:

    $values = $btree->range("\x00", "\xff");

Or get pointers to all leaf nodes:

    $leaves = $btree->leaves();

And then process nodes:

    $values = array();
    foreach ($leaves as $p) {
        list(,$leaf) = $btree->node($leaf);
        $values += $leaf;
    }

Using `leaves()` is depracted.

### Compaction

Does your B+Tree consume a lot of space? Then compact it:

    $btree->compact();
